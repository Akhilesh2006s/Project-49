 * Formspree / Basin / your own function, which receives a JSON POST) or,
 * failing that, an `email` (the form opens the visitor's mail app with the
 * message written out). WhatsApp and phone are shown as links when set.

 * Keep the tone flat: no urgency, no scarcity, none of the banned phrases in
 * command-center/brand/BRAND_BIBLE.md ("enquire now", "book now", ...).
 * Any field left empty is simply not shown.
